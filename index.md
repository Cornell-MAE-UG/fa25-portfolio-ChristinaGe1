## About Me

 Hi! I’m Christina, a mechanical engineering student at Cornell graduating in December 2026. I love building things that move, break, survive, and actually make sense in the real world. Most of my time is split between designing hardware, machining parts, and figuring out how to make complex systems simpler and more reliable. I’ve interned at TeraDAR, where I worked on thermal hardware and machined over a hundred precision parts, and I’ve spent a lot of late nights in the shop bringing ideas from sketches to functioning prototypes. I’m the kind of engineer who learns by doing testing, iterating, and fixing until everything works the way it should.

At Cornell, I lead the mechanical subteam on the Electric Vehicle Project Team, where I mentor a group of 20+ engineers and help build hyper-efficient autonomous EVs from the ground up. I’ve worked on everything from pedal assemblies and autonomous braking to battery containment and system integration. I’ve also explored assistive robotics research and designed a feeding-machine prototype that led to both a publication and a patent. Across all of my projects, what really motivates me is creating thoughtful, useful hardware and working with teams who care about quality, curiosity, and doing things the right way.
